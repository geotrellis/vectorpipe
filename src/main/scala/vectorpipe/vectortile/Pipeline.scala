/**
 * The interface governing the transformation from processed OSM dataframes to
 * vector tiles.
 *
 * After loading an OSM source and transforming via [[OSM.toGeometry]] and any
 * filtering/modification steps, one may want to output a set of vector tiles
 * from the remaining geometry and metadata.  The vector tile output process is
 * governed by a Pipeline definition that describes how to convert a data frame
 * into a set of vector tiles and how to pass information to subsequent zoom
 * levels.
 *
 * [It is worth noting that nothing in this interface restricts the input data
 * to having originated from OSM.  Any DataFrame containing a column of JTS
 * geometry is a valid target.]
 *
 * This API treats vector tile generation as an inherently hierarchical process
 * governed by a series of operations.  Every zoom level will be addressed in
 * the same way, and the sequence of operations can be depicted schematically as
 * below:
 *
 *     ┌──────────┐
 *     │ Zoom z-1 │
 *     └──────────┘
 *          ↑
 *       simplify
 *          ↑
 *        reduce
 *          ↑
 *     ╔══════════╗                          ┌─────────────┐
 *     ║  Zoom z  ║ → select → clip → pack → │ VECTOR TILE │
 *     ╚══════════╝                          └─────────────┘
 *
 * Each of these operations is documented below.  The only extra note is that [[
 * reduce]] and [[simplify]] will be called prior to processing the initial zoom
 * level.

   * Declaration of layer generation style.

   * Some pipelines are simple and require a single layer in the output vector
   * tile, while others require multiple layers.  This value is used by
   * pipelines to declare how layers are generated.  In the simplest case,
   * derived pipelines should declare
   * `val layerMultiplicity = SingleLayer(layerName)` in their definition.  This
   * will cause all geometries to be written out to the layer `layerName`.  For
   * more complex vectortile sets, one may set
   * `val layerMultiplicity = LayerNameInColumn(colName)`; this will require
   * that the custom pipeline create a column of name `colName` containing
   * [[String]] layer names where the different classes of geometries will be
   * found.  Each named layer will be collected separately and aggregated per
